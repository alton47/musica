# Musica 🎧

A lightweight Spotify-inspired music player built with **React.js** to sharpen core frontend skills such as state management, component composition and UI-driven logic.

This project focuses on **replicating familiar UX patterns** found in real-world products while keeping the implementation intentionally simple and readable.

Clean UI. Predictable state. No unnecessary abstractions.
